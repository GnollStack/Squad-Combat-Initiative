### ⚔️ Streamline Your Combat ⚔️
**Do you love throwing hordes of enemies at your players but hate the hassle of managing their initiative?**
Tired of manually averaging initiative rolls?

This module lets you group actors together under clean visual headers with minimal fuss.

## Features

### 1. Easy Group Creation
Create initiative groups directly in the combat tracker using two methods:
*   **Drag & Drop:** Create a group and drag actors directly into it.
*   **Bulk Selection:** Select multiple actors and click the "Add Group" button.

### 2. Flexible Initiative Management
*   **Smart Rolling:** Roll initiative once for the whole group, or individually per member.
*   **Auto-Sorting:** Groups automatically sort by the highest initiative rolled among their members.
